Which means she glides through the shop and headquarters, conquering any and all tasks. A Montana native, the Big Sky state has inspired a life-long pursuit of motion - from Sweden to London, the Appalachian Trail to upstate New York. She’s touched down in Portland to get to know all there is about biking and skiing… two things, which, if you’re in the know, you’ll know involve lots of fast movement.</p>

Naturally, this involves lots of inside time, but don’t worry, he also believes in going outside. Some of his other favorite things are designing furniture, playing video games, and eating tacos. In the shop, he leverages those skills (primarily eating tacos) to coax beautiful shapes from raw materials.</p>
