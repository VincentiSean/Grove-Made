She’s a chocolate enthusiast with a degree in design. She likes to ponder low-waste living and sustainability while biking to work, which is nicely consistent of her.

When the perfect river or stream is found, they bring in the fish with Ben's handmade rods and flies. In his free time, Ben is also hard at work inventing a robot that will sing his favorite lullabies as he prepares to dive into his daily afternoon nap. And beware of disturbing Ben when he's at rest—his prototype Lullaby Robot X-25 is also outfitted with lasers.</p>

Which means she glides through the shop and headquarters, conquering any and all tasks. A Montana native, the Big Sky state has inspired a life-long pursuit of motion - from Sweden to London, the Appalachian Trail to upstate New York. She’s touched down in Portland to get to know all there is about biking and skiing… two things, which, if you’re in the know, you’ll know involve lots of fast movement.</p>
